# Neural Network Practice

## Overview  
Testing a variety of neural network implementations for use in machine learning projects.

## Progress  
The following implementations are in a working state:
1. Custom Network
  - Simple back propagation gradient decent
  - Variety of simple activation function implementations
  - Basic numpy vectorizaiton
  - Relatively fast performance
2. Keras Network
  - Uses the keras package with some custom coding to dynamically build networks
  - Advanced techniques like Adam optimization is available
  - Relatively slower performance
